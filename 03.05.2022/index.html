      <strong>The arts </strong>are a very wide range of human practices of creative expression, storytelling and cultural participation. They
      encompass multiple diverse and plural modes of thinking, doing and being, in an extremely broad range of media. Both highly dynamic and a
      characteristically constant feature of human life, they have developed into innovative, stylized and sometimes intricate forms. This is often
      achieved through sustained and deliberate study, training and/or theorizing within a particular tradition, across generations and even between

      transmitting values, impressions, judgments, ideas, visions, spiritual meanings, patterns of life and experiences across time and space.
