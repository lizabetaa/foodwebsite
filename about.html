    <h2>About arts</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>The arts </strong>are a very wide range of human practices of creative expression, storytelling and cultural participation. They
      encompass multiple diverse and plural modes of thinking, doing and being, in an extremely broad range of media. Both highly dynamic and a
      characteristically constant feature of human life, they have developed into innovative, stylized and sometimes intricate forms. This is often
      achieved through sustained and deliberate study, training and/or theorizing within a particular tradition, across generations and even between
      civilizations. The arts are a vehicle through which human beings cultivate distinct social, cultural and individual identities, while
      transmitting <sub>values</sub>, <sup>impressions</sup>, judgments, ideas, visions, spiritual meanings, patterns of life and experiences across
      time and space.
